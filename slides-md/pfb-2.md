# Plan for today

. . .

## Functions

for not repeating ourselves ;)

. . .

## Boolean operators

operators to produce or combine boolean values

. . .

## Conditional execution

to make our programs branch

# Functions

Functions are sequences of instructions that we store to be executed
later.

# Functions

## Calling functions

The syntax for calling functions is the following:

```
function_name(parameter1, parameter2, parameterN)
```

. . .

## Demo

Let's do a small demo with the functions we already know

# Functions

## Declaring functions

We can declare our own functions using the def keyword with the
following syntax:

```python
def function_name(parameter1, parameter2):
    #function body
```

. . .

When creating a function we need to indent the body to tell Python what piece
of code we want to include inside the function.

. . .

## Demo

# Functions

## Returning values from functions 

Functions in Python can return values after doing all the operations
they perform.

. . .

## Demo

# Functions

## Function Parameters

Parameters are values that are injected to the function body when we
call it

. . .

## Demo

# Checkpoint

Regarding functions, we've seen:

# Boolean operations

We're going to learn two kinds of operators that operate on booleans 
Comparision and logical operators.

Boolean operations are useful for conditional execution.

# Comparision operators

  | name     | description                       |
  | :------- | :-------------------------------- |
  | `x == y` | x is equal to y                   |
  | `x != y` | x is not equal to y               |
  | `x > y`  | x is greater than y               |
  | `x < y`  | x is lesser than y                |
  | `x >= y` | x is greater than or equal than y |
  | `x <= y` | x is lesser than or equal than y  |

. . .

## Demo

- Are two strings the same?
- Are two boolean values different?
- Is this number greater than or equal that other one?

# Logical operators

We use logical operators to combine boolean values.  They are the operators with
the lowest precedence, any other expression will be evaluated before them.

  | name    | description                            |
  | :------ | :------------------------------------- |
  | x and y | returns True if x and y are true       |
  | x or y  | returns True if either x or y are true |
  | not x   | negates x                              |

. . .

## Demo

# Conditional execution

Almost all useful programs need to be able to check conditions and
change its behaviour accordingly.  That's what conditional execution
provides.

# `if` statement

the `if` statement is the tool we use for conditional execution in Python

. . .

```python
if <condition>:
    <body>
```

. . .

## Demo

>- What type will the condition in our if statement have?
>- How can we create a if statement that always executes its body?
>- What about one that never does it?

# Else clause

The else clause is executed when the condition is evaluated to false:

. . .

```python
if <condition>:
    <block>
else:
    <block>
```

. . .

## Demo

>- Check if a user can drive
>- Tell him to wait some time if they can't

# Elif clause

Elif clauses are used when there are more possibilities:

. . .

```python
if <condition>:
    <block>
elif <condition>:
    <block>
else:
    <block>
```

. . .

## Demo

>- Check if a user can drive
>- Check if they're accompanied by an adult
>- Tell them to wait otherwise

# Exercise time!

Let's do an exercise.  We have to create a function that can calculate the area
of either a triangle or a rectangle.

Let's spend 5 mins trying to solve it individually and we'll do that afterwards
together.

# Recap

. . .

Create functions with def. Return to produce a value at the end

. . .

Combine comparision & logical operators to check the conditions you need

. . .

Use if, else, elif for conditional execution

# Exercises

1. Create a function `weekly_commute_time` that asks the user their
   daily commute time and returns their weekly time spent commuting.

2. What do the following expressions return?
   - `True or 11 > 34`
   - `False and (1 == 1)`
   - `(77 // 11) > 6 and False`

3. Create a function `area_triangle` that takes the base and height of
   a triangle and returns its area

   (cont)

# Exercises (Cont)

4. Create function `area_triangle_rectangle` that takes the base,
   height, and the kind of shape and calculates its area.  It should
   work for both triangles and rectangles.

5. Create a function `im_in_love` that takes a weekday number (from
   monday to friday), and returns how that weekday is (according to
   The Cure!):

```
I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's Friday, I'm in love
```
